# Ball_Beam_PID_Control

## Description:

#### The Ball and Beam project is a simple way to learning basic PID control. In the system, the inputs are from the VL53L1X time of flight sensor that gives the distance of the ball relative to the sensor. This is put through a PID control function that will take the input as well as previous inputs to
